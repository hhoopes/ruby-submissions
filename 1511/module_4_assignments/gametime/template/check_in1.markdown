### Game Name
Puts-Puts

### Give a Basic Description of the Game
Basic top-down mini-golf game with traditional golf scoring. It will implement common mini-golf obstacles, such as hills using gradient, blockers, tunnels, windmills, water, and sand traps. 

Snek eats pellets - grows and tries not to run into itself

## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

* Player can swing a club, with visual indication of strength and angle
* Terrain can be flat or angled, indicated by a gradient for the hills
* Strokes are tracked and scored once a ball makes it to the hole (golf scoring, with points based on being over par)
* Sand trap is indicated by a different color/gradient and slows down the speed
* A ball hit into a water trap disappears and reappears at the edge of the water closest to where it went in and player receives +1 to strokes
* Score is tracked with a chart on top of the screen for each hole
* Bumpers obstruct the ball and deflect in an angled direction
* Tunnels: When a ball disappears in a hole other than the final hole, it reappears at a matching hole on a different green
* Windmills: spinning bumpers that block the tunnel to the final hole
* Courses can be procedurally generated 

### What is your MVP, or 'this was harder than I thought' plan?

* 3 holes that don't break! 
* Visual indicator of power/angle gauge on the club
* Obstacles would include: bumpers
*
